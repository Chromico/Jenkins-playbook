Ansible roles and playbook that install Jenkins

Quick overview of what Jenkins is:

Jenkins is CI tool (Continuous Integration) tool which allows you to run and test code with no side effects basically. Due to the fact that Jenkins is open source, it is most widely used and contributed. Using CI tools allow you to save time when developing software or code thus making it much more efficient and cost effective for companies or people that need to get code in the real world fast.

Before CI tools you would usually write the code, test it and deploy it. However if there was a bug or problem in the code it could lead to more problems and have bad side effects from running the code and quite possibly bring everything to a stop. Think of it 
as running a car crash simulation. Performing real crash tests on a car would take more time and would be more costly. If we use a computer simulation we can predict the outcomes much faster without no permanent damage. 

I am of course not comparing car crash simulation software to Jenkins CI but I'm just trying to give you an example for you to get the idea of how CI tools such as Jenkins are useful.
